# JavaCard_FinalProject
A JavaCard applet with a test Client application and a Test script.

The project contains:
- The JavaCard applet application, this can run on a SmartCard, or can be emulated using CREF or JCWDE.
- A client application to test the utilities given by the applet. This can run directly in eclipse IDE and connects with the Applet using Sockets through the port 9025.
- Another way to test the Applet, is to use NetBeans IDE with the already commented written scripts. Check the responses of the applet to see if it works correctly.
